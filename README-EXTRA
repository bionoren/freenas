See README and other official FreeNAS documentation for instructions about setting up a build environment and the build process. This documentation is about installing java for the purpose of running Crashplan on FreeNAS.

You will need to download the following file, which cannot be provided for licensing reasons:
diablo-caffe-freebsd7-amd64-1.6.0_07-b02.tar.bz2

copy this file to FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/ and to os-base/amd64/ports/distfiles/. These directories will not exist initially, so you'll have to run do_build.sh at least twice. Check the end of os-base/amd64/_.cust.add_port_java_* to make sure it built successfully as this package has a tendency to silently fail.

WARNING:
As best I can tell, OpenJDK7 does not support KQueuePollProvider, and is thus not the recommended way to run Crashplan. This support is supposedly being added in OpenJDK8. See the -jdk6 branch for work on a non-linux-emulation solution.
